## Next Steps
1. Review generated issue: `.claude/epics/issue-9751-claude-md-command.md`
2. Start implementation: `/cider:work 2 cli`
3. Focus on preserving git workflow and C.I.D.E.R. methodology in CLAUDE.md

## Business Value
This epic addresses the critical problem where `claude init` (Claude IDE) doesn't include HeyClaudio's methodology, making HeyClaudio the "perfect assistant" for repo work.

## Commands
```bash
# Work on this issue
/cider:work 2 cli

# Check epic status  
/cider:status

# List all epics
