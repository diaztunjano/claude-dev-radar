**The Problem**: You inherit a complex codebase. 2-4 days of exploration just to understand basic structure. Weeks to feel confident making changes.

**The Solution**: Two powerful AI methodologies that give you complete project mastery in 30 minutes.

## ⚡ **Quick Start - See It In Action**

```bash
# Install once, use everywhere
npm install -g claude-dev-radar

# Any unknown repository → Full understanding in 5 minutes
cd mystery-project
claude-radar analyze

# Generate structured issues → Start productive work immediately
claude-cider generate FEATURE "add user authentication"
```

**Result**: Professional technical documentation + structured development roadmap + immediate productivity.

```bash
# Day 1 with new client project
cd client-mysterious-project
claude-setup init        # 30 seconds
claude-radar analyze     # 5 minutes = complete understanding

# Professional deliverables ready:
# ✓ Executive summary for client meetings
# ✓ Technical documentation for development 
# ✓ Evidence-based timeline estimates
# ✓ Structured improvement roadmap
```

### **🎯 Real-World Freelancer Workflow**
